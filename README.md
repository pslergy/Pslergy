# 🛡️ Pslergy — Senior Product Engineer & Systems Architect

I build systems that continue to operate when networks fail, permissions disappear, and assumptions break.

My expertise sits at the intersection of **mobile systems engineering**, **privacy-first architectures**, and **non-standard communication channels**. I specialize in designing and shipping products that work **outside conventional network boundaries** — reliably, covertly, and at scale.

I don’t just write code.
I design **survivable systems**.

## 🧠 Core Focus

* Resilient mobile architectures under OS-level restrictions
* Decentralized & mesh-based communication (BLE, Wi-Fi Direct, Acoustic links)
* Privacy-by-design systems with zero-trust assumptions
* Native + cross-platform orchestration (Flutter ↔ Kotlin)
* End-to-end product ownership: protocol → backend → UX

## 🏗️ Flagship Systems

### 📟 Memento Mori — Autonomous Shadow Mesh Infrastructure

**High-resilience messenger for disconnected or hostile environments**

* **Hybrid Transport Stack:** BLE signaling, Wi-Fi Direct data plane, Ultrasonic Sonar fallback
* **Energy-Aware Orchestration:** Coordinated burst-mode networking for extreme battery efficiency
* **Security:** E2EE (AES-256-GCM), anti-forensic panic protocols, identity ghosting
* **Architecture:** Delay-Tolerant Networking, gossip-based relay, offline-first consistency

This project explores the real limits of modern smartphones as **self-organizing communication nodes**.

### 🌌 Aryonika AI — AI-Driven Relationship Intelligence (Production)

A full-scale consumer platform combining AI, astronomy, and geospatial systems.

* **Scale:** Live in 8 languages, real users, production load
* **Engine:** Python core powered by **Swiss Ephemeris (NASA-grade astronomy)**
* **Matching:** Real-time proximity & compatibility using **PostGIS**
* **AI Layer:** OpenAI-driven interpretation, personalization, and narrative synthesis

Built as a complete product: backend, data models, logic engine, and client integration.

## 🛠 Technical Arsenal

* **Languages:** Dart, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript (Node.js), SQL
* **Platforms:** Android (Native), Flutter, Backend APIs
* **Specialization:**

  * Mesh & P2P networking
  * Signal processing (acoustic data transfer)
  * Secure local persistence & identity migration
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL, SQLite (WAL, ACID-critical systems)

## 🧭 Engineering Philosophy

* Privacy is a **system property**, not a feature
* Offline-first beats cloud-first
* If it can’t survive OS hostility, it’s not production-ready
* Clean abstractions, deterministic state, minimal observable surface

## 📍 Status

* Location: CIS
* Target relocation: **Netherlands 🇳🇱**
* Open to: **Senior Mobile Lead / Product Architect / Systems Engineer** roles
* Focus: High-tech, privacy, AI-driven or infrastructure-heavy products

> *“In an era of total surveillance, privacy is not a luxury — it’s a protocol.”*
