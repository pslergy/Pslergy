## 🏗 Featured Projects

### 1. [Memento Mori](https://github.com/pslergy/memento-mori-app) — Tactical Anti-Censorship Messenger
A high-resilience communication tool designed for internet-denied environments.
*   **Tech:** Hybrid Mesh (Wi-Fi Direct, BLE, Ultrasonic), E2EE (AES-256-GCM), Kotlin Native Layer.
*   **Innovation:** Implemented a Gossip-based ad network and a "Viral" outbox synchronization protocol to find internet gateways through peer-to-peer hops.

### 2. Kismet — AI-Powered Astrology & Dating Ecosystem (Production)
A next-generation social platform blending ancient astrology with modern AI and psychology.
*   **Core Logic:** Custom Python engine using **Swiss Ephemeris** (NASA standard) for precise astronomical calculations (Bazi, Vedic, Western Astrology).
*   **AI Integration:** OpenAI-driven Tarot interpretations and personalized "Cosmic DNA" compatibility matching.
*   **Infrastructure:** Node.js/PostgreSQL with **PostGIS** for real-time proximity discovery, custom WebSocket implementation for high-concurrency chatting.
*   **Reach:** Localized in 8 languages (EN, RU, DE, FR, ES, KO, ZH, HI), adaptive UI for Web/Mobile/Desktop.
